## Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact worldwide. Vaccination is a crucial tool in combating the virus and reducing its spread. This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing the vaccination data for the USA to gain a better understanding of the vaccination efforts and trends.

## Data Sources

The analysis is based on data collected from reliable sources, including:

- [CDC COVID Data Tracker](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/): The primary source for COVID-19 vaccination data in the USA.
- [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/usa-covid19-vaccinations):Kaggle dataset

## Project Overview

In this project, we perform an exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 vaccination data to answer key questions, such as:

- What is the overall vaccination coverage in the USA?
- How has vaccination progressed over time?
- Are there regional variations in vaccination rates?

## Getting Started

To reproduce this analysis and create similar visualizations, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries listed in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook files in the `notebooks` directory.

## Analysis and Visualizations

Our analysis includes various visualizations such as line charts, bar graphs, and geographical maps. These visualizations provide insights into vaccination rates, trends, and regional differences.
